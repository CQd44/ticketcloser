This is a basic front end meant to manage the tickets submitted via my request form script, which is available in a different repository.

It has basic functionality, including:
  Search Tickets
  Refresh Database
  Delete Row
  Show Open Tickets
  Show Closed Tickets
  Show All Tickets
  Close Ticket 
  Generate Report of Current View

All of these are pretty self-explanatory.
The report generated is a CSV that is just a copy of what is currently displayed. It prompts for a filename.

Required modules:
  easygui
  toml
  psycopg2
  tkinter
  PIL
  csv

I know it can be coded better and I do plan on refining certain aspects. The required modules list may change depending on what I decide to do.
